Hey all,
I'm trying to get a feel for whether this idea of mine is good or not. So I made a website to try and describe it (www.zephyreye.com) if anyone wants to check it out.

Basically, the gizmo has GPS, a color LCD screen similar to a cell phone's, and a transmitter. Each player on the field has one (probably integrated with hopper), and it sets up a radar screen to show where other players are on the field the way first person shooters like Halo or Battlefront do.

On top of that, it sets up games. For example, say you're playing "King of the Hill". You start a game with your device, then other players join that game. You set up team starting locations, game length, and "hill" location. The device will keep track of the amount of time a team controls the "hill" location. Whenever a player is hit, it directs them back to their starting location, and once the player reaches that location, starts a timeout and then lets the player (and everyone else on the field) know when he can re-enter gameplay. When game time is up, it automatically tallies the time each team controlled the "hill" and declares a winner.

Similarly, the device will be programmed to setup other games such as Elimination, Team Slayer, and Capture the Flag. Another big advantage is that the data being transmitted around can be sniffed by a laptop or other computer, and then overlaid on a field layout image and projected for spectators. Think like ESPN announcers doing the basketball commentary with onscreen strategy drawings and all that jazz. It'd really open up the game up for spectators if they could look on a big screen and see where everybody is, where they're headed, how much ammo they have left, etc.

Even though it does have the ability to show you where other players are on the field, I'd like to emphasize that the main feature is the _gaming_ feature.  Just showing where the other players are at is easy enough, you can just buy a Garmin for that.  But to be able to make up new methods of gameplay creates a completely new style of paintball that probably shouldn't be compared directly to what you're used to now.

If I decide to take the device to market, I'm hoping I can keep the price down to around $175 to $250 dollars. The website has a lot more details, including pictures of it. Let me know if you guys think this would be cool or just a flop.

Later,
Brad

I think there may be some confusion about what the device would actually do due to other posts, and I'd like to clarify some of these points.

1) Any game can be completely configured the way those playing would like to play the game. Enemy positions, ammo count, etc - If you don't want it, it's not there. Even if you only wanted to view the enemy and no friendlies, you simply configure the game to work that way. One player configures the game, and other people join that pre-configured game. There is no opportunity for any other player to set his or her device up differently.

2) There is no risk of someone being able to view anything they're not supposed to be able to view, e.g. enemy positions, enemy ammo, etc. The system is not hackable without someone who has great skill in reverse engineering and has large amounts of resources and equipment. It's not likely. There is no way for someone using a device to choose to view inappropriate information, hence no real reason to try to track or penalize anyone.

3) Sending tactical commands between teammates is part of the system, e.g. "Attack [coordinates]", "Cover Fire", "Regroup", etc.

4) The hopper will be made using impact resistant methods. Even though the concept art shows external buttons, that's not necessary. Capacitive sensors (like the kind on an iPod) are cheap and easily implementable.

5) On the cost end of things, I imagine rental places would usually make these available for $10-$20/day. They will be able to buy these at wholesale prices rather than retail prices (remember, est. $175-250 suggested _retail_ price) and recover costs within a few months. That lets groups or "the odd man out" rent these gadgets without having to fork out too much dough.

6) A lot of people seem to vehemently oppose the ability to view enemy positions. That's great - no one has to if they don't want to. The idea of being able to do this is that some people enjoy multiplayer online games like Halo, Battlefront, James Bond, etc., where it is an option to view the enemy. This creates a completely new style of game that probably shouldn't be compared directly to what you're used to now. Whether you decide to use it or not, it's an option. I think it might be a great way to get a few people off their couches and out onto the field - good for them and for the sport.  Personally, I would only enable this option occasionally.  While I do think it would fun to be able to do that, I like to sneak around as much as the next guy.

I like the addition of making field size part of the game setup - Hadn't thought of that one. Props! Maybe a warning when you're close and then impose penalty when you go out? The player that sets up the game would go to the coordinates marking edge points, and then that would be part of the configuration that each player's unit would wirelessly receive when they join the game. Therefore, no need for USB or cables of any kind! Any information that needs to get around between them gets around wirelessly.

Also (@ runningbear), if you look at some of the conceptual screenshots (http://www.zephyreye.com/screenshots.htm), you'll see that the current time is already on the screen (at least some of the concept art shows that). Every unit will pick up the EXACT time from atomic clocks that reside in the GPS satellites. The provisional patent that has been submitted also includes the other potential markets you mentioned as alternate uses of the device .

Hope this clears up a few sticky points that seem to keep popping up. If anyone needs more clarification, feel free to ask. It seems this would be easier than just saying "It's hackable" or "It's breakable" when these things aren't necessarily true.

There will probably be multiple versions of the device:

- One version will contain high-quality electronic loader parts, etc., for those players out there who can't use anything but the best.
- One version will be a simple hopper. Same electronics, but no fancy loader parts.
- Another version will be a simple handheld device, that can optionally clamp on to a gun, strap onto a wrist, or be put in a pocket.

In fact, the prototype I'm working on right now is going into a small, plastic enclosure that will probably look something similar to the third category. This will hopefully cover everybody.

There are two different things I think you're talking about, programming and configuring, so I'll try to disambiguate:

Programming:
When someone comes up with a new and unique way to play, and they post it on the website forum or email the idea to me, I'll program it up and make it available for download. This probably isn't something that I will divulge enough information on for any other programmers to be able to work on. Most new gameplay styles won't be too hard for me to program, and it keeps people buying the units. A separate device will be sold for probably around $25 that plugs into your USB port and allows you to send the new program (wirelessly) to your ZephyrEye unit. It'll be simple for non-techies to do this, don't worry.

This will also be useful for, say, tournaments that decide they want to create special tournament rules or gameplay styles, or fields that want a few particulars embedded into the software.

Configuring:
This is the part that is pretty simple. When you start a game, the device will walk you through a few steps to help you configure how you want to play. Using king of the hill as an example: It will ask you a few questions, such as radius of starting locations and hill, if you want field boundaries, friendly and opfor radar viewing options, game time length, etc. Then it will ask you to walk to those locations (both team's starting locations, hill location, and field boundaries) and press a button so that it can log the coordinates to that geographic location. Then the device will ask you if you want to save these settings for future games, so when you return to the field next weekend and want to play it exactly the same way, you can without having to go through the whole configuration process again. Then it will allow other players to join your game, which forces all players joining that game to use the same configuration (they have no choice if they want to play). They must join the correct team, and be at the correct starting location for the team they have joined. When all players are at their starting location, the device will let you start the game, and broadcast to everyone that the game has begun. Then when the game time limit has been reached, the ZephyrEye system will alert everyone by declaring a winner and displaying scores. If I feel the creative urge, I may even program in some awards (e.g., Most Cowardly, Most Courageous, Most Useless, [insert favorite 007 award here], etc.) that would be displayed at this time as well.

Then you can start all over again. This process will be user friendly and most people who know how to use this forum will have no problem configuring a ZephyrEye unit. The nice thing about this is that you can try out a lot of different ways to play the same game by just using different configurations, which will keep interest level a little higher for a little longer.

@ Maunz: Yeah, I know the concept art kinda sucks. That's what you get when you do it yourself. It's mostly just there to get the general idea across. The final appearance will change and be solidified as it gets closer to being manufactured, which I'm hoping will happen sometime in 2008. Sorry for the vague time frame, but at this stage that's the best I can say.

And BTW, the idea has been submitted to the US Patent & Trademark Office and is legally "Patent Pending".

Hey guys,

I put some pictures of the prototypes up online at http://www.zephyreye.com/gallery2.htm . I'm still chasing a couple of bugs down, so they don't show any gaming, but the series of pictures should help you see how the game is setup. If you don't see a peice of setup you were expecting (e.g. field borders, etc.), it's probably because I just haven't gotten that far yet. I'm hoping to be able to show some simple gameplay by the end of next week, along with some video if I can get it to look decent with my digital camera.

Feel free to leave questions or comments either here or on my forum.

Hey guys, 

I just realized that some people were a bit concerned about the size of the prototypes because the pictures don't have any common objects next to the units to gauge how big they are. The enclosures are 3.72" x 2.49" x 1.10".  I put another picture on the website to help you visually gauge the size.
